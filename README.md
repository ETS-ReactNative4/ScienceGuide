# ScienceGuide

## What is ScienceGuide? 
MyScienceGuide is a React Native application that connects Latin American high schools students who are interested in research or competing in Science Fairs with qualified research mentors. Our application will allow students to sign up and indicate their prior research skills, experience, and interests and then we will match students to corresponding mentors who meet their qualifications. We also provide a chat functionality for users and mentors to connect.
